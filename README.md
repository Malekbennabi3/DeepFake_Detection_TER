# Objectives of the project:
The main objective of this work is to propose deep learning-based methods for binary image classification.
for binary image classification (True/False) and then to evaluate the performance of these implemented approaches.

# The implemented approches
In this project we have implemented 3 distinct approaches, each based on a very specific technique:

- Direct approach (CNN)
- Frequency approach (Fourier spectrum)
- Dimensionality reduction approach (Auto-encoder)
